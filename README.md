## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm ilydoa, a Computer Science student with an interest in Data Science/AI. I am proficient in Python, Java, C, and React.js. 

- ðŸŒ± I previously interned with the Library of Congress on the "Collaging Through Space and Time" project and worked with industry mentors from Relativity Software on a sentiment analysis and LLM exploration project.
- ðŸ’¬ Here, you'll find those projects and some of my Hackathon projects, including my project with the game "Escape the Music Forest" from Technica 2024's Best Gameification Hack category
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy music theory!
